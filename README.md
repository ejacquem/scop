# scop
SCOP is a 42 project where you create a simple 3D model viewer from scratch. The goal is to load .obj files, apply transformations like scaling, rotation, and translation, and render the result using OpenGL. Itâ€™s an introduction to graphics programming, focusing on shaders, matrices, and basic rendering techniques.
